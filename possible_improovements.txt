This file has possible auxiliary improovements and notes for Security Nexus
===============================================================================

- Aligning with "Polkadot Cloud" Terminology: The ecosystem is increasingly
framing itself as the "Polkadot Cloud" or "Web3 Cloud" . We can position the
Security Nexus as the native security layer for the Polkadot Cloud, where each
parachain is a composable service. This aligns us with the ecosystem's core
marketing narrative.

- Leverage the Latest Polkadot 2.0 Capabilities: Identifying Agile Coretime is
key, we can strengthen it by explicitly mentioning how our tools
are designed for an ecosystem with Elastic Scaling , where parachains can
dynamically access multiple cores. This shows our solution is built for the
future of Polkadot, not just its past.

- Clarify the "Radically Useful" for Web2 Developers: One hackathon goal is to
onboard Web2 developers . While your tool is highly technical, emphasize how
your Web Dashboard & API and clear documentation lower the security barrier for
developers new to Substrate, making it "radically useful" for a broader
audience.
